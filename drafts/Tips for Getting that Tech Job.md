I've been very fortunate in my career and that has lead to many people asking me for advice about how they can also get a tech job. I'm a bit bias here, but I think tech jobs are largely good jobs. Many offer good benefits, competitive pay, and a fair work-life balance. There is a real and valid reason why technology jobs tend to always be in demand. Luckily tech is an ever growing field and more of a meritocracy than many other professions which means that getting a tech job can be feasible goal. 

I don't say this lightly: breaking into tech is very difficult and super competitive. Many good and smart people give up. Below is some of things that helped me break into tech. Every persons journey is unique to them and I don't have a magic solution that allows anyone to break into tech but I hope these can points can help. 

### The obvious but important stuff

#### You've got to pass the interview
There is no getting around it: you've got to pass the interview. As stated above, technology tends to be a bit of a meritocracy and consequently, the interviews are gruelingly difficult. In many cases the interviews tend to be harder than the actual job. There are a lot of resources out there about passing interviews, so I'm not going to go into it further here. 

#### Having a professional LinkedIn helps
This another unfortunate reality: having a professional LinkedIn helps. Having a professional looking picture, many connections, and a well written work history will help make the job search smoother. Don't let the hoodies trick you: technology jobs are white-collar jobs and LinkedIn has become a defacto resume for white-collar work. 

#### Get into a routine and stick with it

### The less obvious but important stuff 

#### Go where the jobs are 
Entrepreneurs are always building and venture capitalist are always deploying capital, which means there are always a group of companies that are growing ad actively hiring. Obviously during times of boom there are more companies that fit this description, but even during down periods there are companies successfully raising cash. When venture capitalize give money to entrepreneurs they are expecting those companies to grow, meaning they are actively hiring and highly motivated. In my experience this is the best lead for breaking into tech. Personally I read [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) and [FinSME](https://www.finsmes.com/) daily and these help me stay informed on the companies actively raising capital.
