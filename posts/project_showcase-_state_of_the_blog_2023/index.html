I suffered from analysis paralysis: should I use an off-the-shelf product like medium, wordpress, or substack, or should I build my tool? How complicated should my tool be if I decide to make one? And what would I actually write about, should it consist more of my professional coding, or should I talk about finance stuff, or more my personal interests? </p><p>As I've progressed in my technology career it has become apparent to me that the best senior engineers are great technical writers. They use their technical writing to up-level their team around them. I love being an individual contributor and want to continue that career path for the forseeable future. I ultimately have decided to use this blog to mostly write technical pieces in order to showcase my technical writings and to further improve my writing skills. </p><p>I started building a list on my phone of possible blog ideas and I told myself I would start blogging once a month. I'm still learning and I'm having fun along the way.</p><h3 id="productionrequirements">Production requirements</h3><p>I finally assigned myself a weekend to get this off the ground and gave myself the below product requirements: </p><ol>
<li>I've got one weekend to build this, with hosting on a custom URL, and a single blog post written.</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li>I want to own the project and not use a third party blogging platform.</li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li>I want to write markdown. I like writing markdown. </li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li>I want the site to be clean, minimalist, and have an overall brutalism web design with emphasis on readability</li>
</ol><p>It goes without saying, but the product requirements for this blog won't be the same as another project. It helped me to write down what I wanted, and to work on just those things in order to overcome my analysis paralysis.</p><h3 id="thecode">The code</h3><p>Without further ado, <a href="https://github.com/Kyle01/public_blog">here is the github for this page with all the code</a> for everyone to checkout.</p><p>As you may be able to tell, there really isn't too much here. Two javascript functions and a single style sheet power this entire site. Maybe as time passes and the product requirements change, I'll build this out further, but right now I feel like this all works pretty well for me. </p><p>All my writings live in the <code>writings</code> folder and are written in markdown. The magic comes in running <code>npm run generate</code> where the <code>generate_script.js</code> fires and creates the html pages using the package <a href="https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown">showdown</a>. All of the styling is written in css and is located in <code>style.css</code> on the top level. There is a <code>javascript.js</code> package that works to puts a JSON of the list of posts on the front page. Hosting is even easier- I bought a domain on google domains and Github Pages does the rest of the work. </p><h3 id="juststartwriting">Just start writing!</h3><p>I love having a personal blog! I'm upset at myself for putting this off as long as I did. I love seeing personal blogs having a comeback. The most important part of a blog is the writing so I encourage everyone who has a voice to start writing and find a way to make a blog that works for you. </p>
