All of my professional employment has been to construct internal applications which have been guarded deeply behind serious corporate firewalls. But as an engineer I try to learn about all areas of web development, and SEO and is a significant piece of frontend development.</p><p>Recently, I showed a friend who is employed as a growth marketing consultant my website. They quickly pulled up <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview">Google Lighthouse</a> and showed how my site had fairly good metrics in Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices, but was weak in SEO. </p><p><img src="https://kyle-mcv-blog-pictures.s3.amazonaws.com/LighthousePreOptimization.png" alt="Lighthouse Pre Optimization" width="500" height="auto" /></p><p>This came as largely a surprise to me, I never considered optimizing for SEO, but took it as a learning opportunity. Turns out I was missing a <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet">meta</a> tag in my header. I also changed the generate script to generate a <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap">sitemap</a> for crawlers and a robot.txt file with those details. Those changes were made in isolation and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Kyle01/public_blog/pull/1">this pull request</a>. </p><p>Making those changes moved up my SEO score. Hooray!</p><p><img src="https://kyle-mcv-blog-pictures.s3.amazonaws.com/LighthousePostOptimization.png" alt="Lighthouse Post Optimization" width="500" height="auto" /></p><p>I also updated my <code>style.css</code> to include formatting for imgs and partitioned an S3 bucket for blog photos, so now the website supports photos! Big improvement which was long overdue. </p><p>The blog has been fun to build and add to over time. I look forward adding more features in the future. </p>
