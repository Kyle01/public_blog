# Overview
This serves as my personal public blog. I write the posts in markdown and then a small script converts them to html pages. I enjoy writing markdown and having full ownership of the blog, so this seemed like the lightest weight option.

# Technology
* Javascript ES6
* [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) 
* Github pages
* HTML & CSS

# Pending items
* Need to test out pictures via s3 
* Would like to build some CD/CI that automatically runs the generate script
* Will consider switching from github pages to cloudflare pages
