I've been very fortunate in my career, I've been able to work along some amazing engineers. I'm thankful for the time we've spent together professionally and I'm lucky enough to be able to call many of them my friends after our employment together. As I progress my career and work towards becoming a senior engineer myself, I've reflected on the skills I've seen in my senior coworkers that I'd like emulate in my own career. Below is an incomplete list of similarities I've seen in the best engineering team member's I've ever had:

### Technical Expertise
I listed this first not because it is the most important, but because it is the most obvious. When I think back on the best engineer's I've worked with, they've all had elite domain level knowledge in one technology and at least a working level understanding of the entire stack. These engineers are up-to-date on the best practices of their domain and are constantly learning their evolutions. They are the obvious decision makers when making architecture decisions in their domain. At the same time they have a working knowledge of the company's entire stack and aren't lost to areas outside of their own expertise. They have their own mentors in the programming community and embrace making themselves a student at any opportunity. They have a passion for their craft and it is apparent to everyone around them. At moments of frustration and confusion they have a zen and appreciation that can only come from a love of their work. 

### Solutions Oriented
The best realize that their work as a programmer is a tool to solve a problem. They lean into learning about the business they work in and collaborate with product to deliver the most value in the least amount of engineering possible. They work with all stakeholders, inside and outside of the engineering organization, to add transparency and insight to the process. They make the difficult tasks possible.

### Team Focused
When I look back on my career and reflect on the best engineer's I'd want to have along side me today, they were all team players. They recognized that we win together as a team and they actively work to up-level everyone. They recognize their own domain expertise and let other lead when appropriate. Their work leaves behind a cohesive set of notes so others can grow from their knowledge. Most importantly, they always find time to sit with junior people and teach them in a way that is helpful and never demeaning.

### Self Ownership 
The best engineers execute. They seem to understand "You're only as good as your last commit" and consistently deliver value. They are reliable to themselves, their follow coworkers, and the business. They take ownership of not only their work, but the work of their teammates and make sure to make good on the most important features and snuff the toughest bugs. They find a way to complete the task and exhibit astonishing problem solving skills along the way. 

This is a very incomplete list and there are a lot of ways to be best. Simply put: the best engineers I've worked with are special. I hope that one day I can be special enough that my coworkers will consider me as one of the best coder they've ever worked with.
