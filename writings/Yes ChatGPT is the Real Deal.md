## Yes ChatGPT is the Real Deal

I'm not a AI expert and I'm not to try to pretend to be, but I am a technologist and a product engineer so I've been dabbling a bit with ChatGPT. It is obvious to me that ChatGPT and the other AI tools available right now are mature enough to make a measurable impact into how all technology is going to be developed moving forward. 

Recently I've been pulled into very senior meetings and asked to provide insight about how ChatGPT is going to change the technology landscape and how we can begin using ChatGPT today. These are hard questions and I don't have any great insight. It is humbling moment for me and many others to see just how strong these tools are and how quickly they are being developed. 

The analogy I've been telling others that I want to highlight here is the concept of the [Wait Calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel#Wait_calculation) from interstellar travel. This is sometimes also referred to as the [Wait Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait/walk_dilemma). Simply put, when technology is advancing so quickly, it can be better to wait for it to further progress before embracing it when trying to build a process that will take time to play out. Right now AI feels like it is improving so quickly that it is hard to imagine building a product around it that will still be relevant in even a few months. 

It really does feel like we're in the first inning of a new technology age. I imagine this is what it felt like building technology during the dawn of the internet in 1995 or considering mobile apps during the beginning of the iPhone in 2007. 

I don't think ChatGPT is going to be a flash-in-the-pan, I think it is the whole ball game. s
